## CBI 

# The starting point for payment type ordinals.
# If core payment types are to be included then remove this or set it to -1.  
ordinalBase=200

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# For new payment types, GRNDS virtual properties like the following 
# will be generated by the payment deployment code:
#    paymentType.999  = enableMYPAYMENT
#    paymentLabel.999 = paymentLabel.MYPAYMENT
# 
# A corresponding payment label for the the SAM screens needs to be added
# to Web resources. FOr example:
#    paymentLabel.MYPAYMENT = My new payment
