# locale.search_using_language_part
# When determining the locale to associate with a user at runtime, the browser
# submits a string of locales, each being weighted to indicate their precedence.
# The first locale which matches to a valid system locale will be chosen.
# If the locale format is language_country (e.g. en_us) and it doesn't match
# any system locale, we can either move onto the next locale, or try to match
# just the language part (en). This setting determines which option to use.
